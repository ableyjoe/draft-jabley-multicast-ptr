==========================

   The mapping of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to names using the Domain Name
   System (DNS) is colloquially known as "Reverse Mapping".  Reverse
   Mapping support for registered multicast address assignments in IPv4
   is currently incomplete and ad-hoc; in IPv6 there is no support at
   all.

   This document describes procedures to be followed that will result in
   more systematic and predictable support for Reverse Mapping for IPv4
   multicast address assignments, and introduces analogous support for
   IPv6.
